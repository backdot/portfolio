## Welcome to my blog!

Hi, I'm Phil!

I have learned many things about web development (and life!) over the years while browsing the web.
Of course for every piece of content that lives on the internet someone has to
put in a certain amount of effort into publishing that content.

It is only natural that one wants to give back sooner or later.
That is why I will be joining the open-source community as a contributor. That means submitting pull requests every now and then to all the awesome projects I am using on a daily basis. Keep an eye on my [GitHub](https://github.com/backdot) for that!

I am also trying to put some of my (hopefully at least *somewhat*) original thoughts out here on this blog.
Let this be the first step in that direction! ðŸ’ª
